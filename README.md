Deepfake Image Detection with Keras &amp; TensorFlow

<br> 

## Description

This project aims to guide developers to train a deep learning-based deepfake detection model from scratch using [Python](https://www.python.org), [Keras](https://keras.io) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org). The proposed deepfake detector is based on the state-of-the-art EfficientNet structure with some customizations on the network layers, and the sample models provided were trained against a massive and comprehensive set of deepfake datasets. 

The proposed deepfake detection model is also served via a standard web-based interface at [DFDetect](http://deepfakedetection.eastasia.cloudapp.azure.com) to assist both the general Internet users and digital media providers in identifying potential deepfake contents. It is hoped that such approachable solution could remind Internet users to stay vigilant against fake contents, and ultimately help counter the emergence of deepfakes.

### Overview

Videos generated by artificial intelligence techniques, culturally known as "deepfakes", are being created and shared by the public at an alarming rate. There are various easy-to-use tools accessible on the Internet for anyone to create realistic manipulated videos and audios. This constitutes a serious threat to the fields of information authenticity, media legitimacy and digital forensics, as deepfakes have the ability to distort reality, erode trust, and spread misinformation.
